"I cant just believe what i saw today!Paytm is laying off 5000+ employees, too, after few months of mass layoffs, 18000 members life affected directly and indirectly if this happens, I really feel for those employees, especially who commute everyday , work 9 hours a day,  support from home , weekends and sacrifice time for this day,of being abandoning due to loss.I agree companies make loss , but sending them like this is not fair at all, no wonders my decision of quitting tech and fast paced it tech to medium paced companies is worth it. Sometimes, i feel this struggle is not worth it as my mental health matters a lot.Sending strength to all those folks, you deserved better .#layoff#tech#paytm#tech"
"How to deal with #LAYOFF It's Monday morning, and you're ready to head to your office when suddenly you see a mail notification: ""LAYOFF Vee.. Sin..."" As a quality analyst, you feel shattered but gather the courage to stand up and cross-verify by directly calling HR.""Hello, Miss HR, is this layoff notice for real?"" you ask.""Unfortunately, yes, Vee..,"" HR responds. ""I cannot help you with this, and I wish you a bright future.""In your mind, you wonder, ""What's next? Am I not good enough, or is the company cutting costs by reducing my expenses? Whatever it is, it's happened now.""""Vee...., my dear, you know yourself well. Your capabilities are not determined by a layoff. Search for your next job immediately, as you have expenses to cover. Update your resume, learn new skills, and within one, two, or three weeks, you'll receive multiple job offers.(edit- getting a job early depends on the network,skill set, job opportunities and early preparation).""Here are some tricks:Never blame others for anything; they are profit-driven entities. If you're not providing more value than what they spend on you, you'll end up losing.As a tester, prepare for the worst-case scenario. Even if everything seems fine, you never know how things might turn out.Believe in your skills; there are multiple companies out there, not just one. You'll find another job soon. However, never deceive yourself. Others might misjudge your potential, but you know your weaknesses. Be humble enough to work on them.Life isn't a dreamland where people shower you with rose petals. Always learn from people's experiences, both their hardships and joys, and be empathetic to all, even during your best days. Observation is the key.#veenasingh #layoff#qaulityanalyst#tester"

"Recently i have been silently laid off. What is new Silent #Layoff?A ""silent layoff"" refers to a situation where a company reduces its workforce without formally announcing layoffs.-This can involve tactics such as not replacing employees who leave, cutting hours or pay, not giving promotion and hike, reassigning duties to other employees, or creating a work environment that encourages voluntary departures.-The goal is often to downsize the workforce without the negative publicity and morale issues associated with traditional layoffs.This term has gained traction as companies navigate economic uncertainties and look for ways to manage costs discreetly.#lookingforopportunies"
