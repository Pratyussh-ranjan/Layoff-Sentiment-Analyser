"when you are a candidate looking for job with experiance and tell HR that you resigned during layoff and not working from few months, then they start doubting you and asked questions like do you have EPFO details, do you work at which location can you tell me the address, share your PAN card details, date of Birth.They think like they are facing a fake candidate and wrong guy, that's why his/her job is gone. don't know how to tell them that i worked hard and completed my each and every task assigned to me, completed on time with accuracy, but is it worth explaining to them about your character in company or how you performed till now.Now is their any character certificates or performance certificates provided by companies so we can prove to next employer.#layoff #newjob #interview #switch #jobs #character #statusofmind #layoff2024"
