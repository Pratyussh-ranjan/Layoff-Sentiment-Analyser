"I am the victim of silent #layoff at Infosys recently, got laid off without any warnings and future career support. On the same day, within few hours my whole internal access taken after forcefully telling me to resign. Not even giving notice period so that we can have at least some time to apply for new jobs without being jobless. I know the name of the person involved in my case but I can't say here due to confidentiality. In this much reputed company also like this happened.When we never thought to leave the current job but next day suddenly HR person schedules a meeting to announce the exit and force to leave the company. How much bad it is but who care. I thought to say here because it is something that should not happen. Like this event can destroy someone's career but who care.Infosys, I seek your attention in this case."
"I recently experienced a silent #layoff at Rakuten Symphony without any warning or future career support. My internal access was revoked within hours, and I was forced to resign without a notice period, leaving me no time to apply for new jobs before being unemployed. While I know the person involved, confidentiality prevents me from naming them.It's troubling when an HR meeting is suddenly scheduled to announce an unexpected exit, forcing me to leave the company. Such events can be detrimental to someone's career, which is why I felt compelled to share this here.Rakuten Symphony  I urge you to address this situation promptly, as it is something that should not happen and can significantly impact individuals' careers.#Layoff #JavaDeveloper #Java #TechLayoffs"

Sometimes, i feel this struggle is not worth it as my mental health matters a lot.Sending strength to all those folks, you deserved better .#layoff#tech#paytm#tech"
"How to deal with #LAYOFF It's Monday morning, and you're ready to head to your office when suddenly you see a mail notification: ""LAYOFF Vee.. Sin..."" As a quality analyst, you feel shattered but gather the courage to stand up and cross-verify by directly calling HR.""Hello, Miss HR, is this layoff notice for real?"" you ask.""Unfortunately, yes, Vee..,"" HR responds. ""I cannot help you with this, and I wish you a bright future.""In your mind, you wonder, ""What's next? Am I not good enough, or is the company cutting costs by reducing my expenses? Whatever it is, it's happened now.""""Vee...., my dear, you know yourself well. Your capabilities are not determined by a layoff. Search for your next job immediately, as you have expenses to cover. Update your resume, learn new skills, and within one, two, or three weeks, you'll receive multiple job offers.(edit- getting a job early depends on the network,skill set, job opportunities and early preparation).""Here are some tricks:Never blame others for anything; they are profit-driven entities. If you're not providing more value than what they spend on you, you'll end up losing.As a tester, prepare for the worst-case scenario. Even if everything seems fine, you never know how things might turn out.Believe in your skills; there are multiple companies out there, not just one. You'll find another job soon. However, never deceive yourself. Others might misjudge your potential, but you know your weaknesses. Be humble enough to work on them.Life isn't a dreamland where people shower you with rose petals. Always learn from people's experiences, both their hardships and joys, and be empathetic to all, even during your best days. Observation is the key.#veenasingh #layoff#qaulityanalyst#tester"

"Recently i have been silently laid off. What is new Silent¬†#Layoff?A ""silent layoff"" refers to a situation where a company reduces its workforce without formally announcing layoffs.-This can involve tactics such as not replacing employees who leave, cutting hours or pay, not giving promotion and hike, reassigning duties to other employees, or creating a work environment that encourages voluntary departures.-The goal is often to downsize the workforce without the negative publicity and morale issues associated with traditional layoffs.This term has gained traction as companies navigate economic uncertainties and look for ways to manage costs discreetly.#lookingforopportunies"
"when you are a candidate looking for job with experiance and tell HR that you resigned during layoff and not working from few months, then they start doubting you and asked questions like do you have EPFO details, do you work at which location can you tell me the address, share your PAN card details, date of Birth.They think like they are facing a fake candidate and wrong guy, that's why his/her job is gone. don't know how to tell them that i worked hard and completed my each and every task assigned to me, completed on time with accuracy, but is it worth explaining to them about your character in company or how you performed till now.Now is their any character certificates or performance certificates provided by companies so we can prove to next employer.#layoff #newjob #interview #switch #jobs #character #statusofmind #layoff2024"
