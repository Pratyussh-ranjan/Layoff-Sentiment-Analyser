"I am the victim of silent #layoff at Infosys recently, got laid off without any warnings and future career support. On the same day, within few hours my whole internal access taken after forcefully telling me to resign. Not even giving notice period so that we can have at least some time to apply for new jobs without being jobless. I know the name of the person involved in my case but I can't say here due to confidentiality. In this much reputed company also like this happened.When we never thought to leave the current job but next day suddenly HR person schedules a meeting to announce the exit and force to leave the company. How much bad it is but who care. I thought to say here because it is something that should not happen. Like this event can destroy someone's career but who care.Infosys, I seek your attention in this case."
"I recently experienced a silent #layoff at Rakuten Symphony without any warning or future career support. My internal access was revoked within hours, and I was forced to resign without a notice period, leaving me no time to apply for new jobs before being unemployed. While I know the person involved, confidentiality prevents me from naming them.It's troubling when an HR meeting is suddenly scheduled to announce an unexpected exit, forcing me to leave the company. Such events can be detrimental to someone's career, which is why I felt compelled to share this here.Rakuten Symphony  I urge you to address this situation promptly, as it is something that should not happen and can significantly impact individuals' careers.#Layoff #JavaDeveloper #Java #TechLayoffs"
The Creamy Layer Paradox for Layoffs #layoff
"**** When Media.net called bouncers to #layoff we write it on LinkedIn**** When we pay 30% direct tax and don't get any benefit we write it on LinkedIn **** When a minor kills 2 engineers on his #porsche car we write it on LinkedIn **** When government is taking no action against brutal #layoffs we write it on LinkedIn **** When the government is busy giving licences to new engineering colleges and #freshers struggling to find their first job since years, we write it on LinkedIn.I think the biggest problem of #itinudstry employees currently is, we don't have a union. Government knows there are many departments which are of no use, still they don't don't close them and fire the employees !! because they are worried about the union ?Do you feel it is the right time of #itemployees to have a union ? Where we could get justice for some of our problems ? Follow me and I will help you to up skill yourself to find your dream job: Vasanth Bhat#software #industry #need #union #community #support"
